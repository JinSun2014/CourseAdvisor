            "text": " Popularized by movies such as \"A Beautiful Mind\", game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Over four weeks of lectures, this advanced course considers how to design interactions between agents in order to achieve good social outcomes. Three main topics are covered: social choice theory (i.e., collective decision making), mechanism design, and auctions. In the first week we consider the problem of aggregating different agents' preferences, discussing voting rules and the challenges faced in collective decision making. We present some of the most important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow's Theorem, which proves that there is no \"perfect\" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems. We move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain \"mechanism design\" -- a broad framework for designing interactions between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms. The course wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating scarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides an introduction to auction theory.",

If you miss a problem set deadline, you may complete it before the end of the course for half credit. You may discuss problems from the problem sets with other students in an online forum, without providing explicit answers. . Final Exam. There will be an online final exam that you will have to complete within two weeks of its posting. Once you begin the exam, you will have four hours to complete it. . Screen-side Chats.

On August 17, Governor Pat Quinn signed Senate Bill 3724, amending the implementation date of the 2012 IECC to January 1, 2013. The Illinois Energy Office has a belief that teaching energy simulation for commercial buildings \"as a game,\" will appeal to designers, code officials and building owners implementing the 2012 IECC and ASHRAE 90.1, while better engaging their fellow engineers and energy modelers early in the building design processes. This workshop will introduce participants to the energy modeling process in the form of a game, where \"integrated\" teams of designers, code officials and building owners are exposed to competitive rounds selecting energy efficiency measures (EEMs) for a prototype building. The goal, to provide an introductory understanding of the energy modeling process, its challenges and rewards using OpenStudio((R)) and EnergyPlus((R)) to empower the Illinois design community.

Rhymes also spark a child's excitement about what comes next, which adds fun and adventure to reading. ★",

Watch such programs with your child and join in with him on the rhymes and songs. Here are a few tips about introducing your child to art: -Don't tell the child what to draw or paint. -Don't \"fix up\" your child's drawings. It will take lots of practice before you can recognize what he has drawnbut let him be creative! Invite your child to talk to you about what he is drawing and to identify by name each object in the picture. -Give your child lots of different materials to work with. Show her how to use new types of materials. -Find an art activity that's at the right level for your child and let him do as much of the project as possible. -Display your child's art prominently in your home. Point it out to visitors when your child is near to hear the praise.",

The River Edge Redevelopment Initiative includes the designation of redevelopment zones that will be eligible to receive tax credits, exemptions and new grant funding to support clean-up, remediation and redevelopment efforts that will lead to economic revitalization in these areas. This initiative combines resources across state agencies and will be administered primarily by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA). Only Aurora, East St. Louis and Rockford can apply to DCEO for designation. Implementation Status To date, DCEO has designated zones in the cities of Aurora and Rockford.

Aurora Zone The City of Aurora River Edge Redevelopment Zone consists of former industrial land lining its east and west riverfronts that have tremendous economic development potential, but the cost of redevelopment have made attracting investment extremely difficult.

If applicable, HP will determine in its sole discretion that Customer Self Repair is the appropriate method of warranty service. If so, HP will ship approved replacement parts directly to you to fulfill your HP Hardware Product warranty service. This will save considerable repair time. After you contact HP and the fault diagnosis identifies that the problem can be fixed using one of these parts, a replaceable part can be sent directly to you. Once the part arrives, replace the defective part pursuant to the provided instructions and documentation. If further assistance is required, call the HP Technical Support Center and a technician will assist you over the phone. In cases where the replacement part must be returned to HP, you must ship the defective part back to HP within a defined period of time, normally fifteen (15) days. The defective part must be returned with the associated documentation in the provided shipping material. Failure to return the defective product may result in HP billing you for the replacement. With a Customer Self Repair, HP will pay all shipping and part return costs and determine the courier/carrier to be used. If Customer Self Repair applies to you, please refer to your specific HP Hardware Product announcement. You can also obtain information on this warranty service on the HP Web site at: http://www.hp.com/support",

In searching one factor at a time, if we can assume that the response is typically quadratic (with a single maximum, assuming we are maximizing a response value, such as the test accuracy), then instead of trying all values, we can have an iterative procedure where starting from some initial runs, we fit a quadratic, find its maximum analytically, take that as the next estimate, run an experiment there, add the resulting data to the sample, and then continue fitting and sampling, until we get no further",
